The story follows Magnus Gallant, a recent graduate of the Ischka Military Academy,
and fledgling captain in Palatinus' Southern region, Alba. As civil war erupts in the country, 
Magnus eventually decides to join the revolution with its leader, Frederick Raskin, first liberating the southern region with the Zenobians' aid, 
then Nirdam and uniting with them, then returning the Eastern Region of Capitrium to the Orthodox church, and finally marching on the capital of Latium.
However, along the way, Magnus' battalion, the Blue Knights, finds its enemies escalating, 
from the puppet kingdom of Palatinus, to the might of the Holy Lodis Empire, to the Dark Hordes of the Netherworld.
There are three possible Endings determined by the player's Chaos Frame, and within those endings are slight scene variations depending on the characters who joined the player's army.
All three possible endings have one thing in common: Frederick dies an untimely death. The Chaotic ending is an ending where Magnus gets expelled from the revolutionary army,
because they consider him a "monster" who settles everything by force;
realizing that his actions were for naught, he disappears and the people forget about the great general who once saved them, therefore ensuring Palatinus' destruction due to Barbarians.
In "Neutral" ending, he is named "General Magnus Gallant, the guardian of Palatinus". The last one is Lawful, after Frederick dies an untimely death,
the war against the tribes Of the East of Gallea and Zeteginia, who wanted to invade Palatinus right after Lodis weakened it, attack;
Magnus is named: "Magnus Gallant, The Paladian King"; his rule becomes forever to be remembered and his son Aeneas Gallant takes the Throne, following his father's footsteps.
